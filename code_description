Fisher Iris Dataset is loaded and manipulated using Pandas, the data analysis python library.

We used matplotlib to draw the univariate and multivariate distributions.
Box and whisker plot helps us visualize the data by plotting the
Minimum, first quartile, median, second quartile and maximum.

sklearn.model_selection_Kfold first shuffles the dataset using the random number generator whose sees is provided by us. 
Then splits it into n_splits components and turn by turn trains on 9 of them and tests on the 1 component left.
So the split is:
Break the 150 observations into : 120(train+validate)+30(test) (80%,20%) 
120 is further split as : 108(train)+12(validate)  (90%,10%)
We train every model using the 108 observations and then validate each of them on the 12 observations of the validation set.
The algorithm giving maximum accuracy is selected and used for test data.
Precision is the ratio tp/(tp+fp) : ability to label as negative a sample that is actually negative.
Recall is th ratio tp/(tp=fn) : ability to classify all teh positive samples.
f1-score is the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall. best value is 1 worst being 0.
Support is the number of occurences of each class in Y_test.
